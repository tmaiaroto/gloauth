I would LOVE contributions to this project. It is an open-source project after all.

Pull requests and requests for features will be accepted if they suit the project's goals.
I can't even promise I'll be quick to respond to issues or pull requests.

Also note that I want to do my best to keep the code clean, so it needs to pass various
checks, see: https://serifandsemaphore.io/tools-to-help-you-go-d6f782055ce7
